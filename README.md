# FoodHere 
 FoodHere is a mobile website designed to showcase the capabilities of cloud database access for web applications in one of its rawest forms.

 With the capability to dynamically update data visible to users, 'places' can be added or removed and the user's view will reflect the updated database in an instant.


Images can be stored in the database for client-side focused loading on page load.
